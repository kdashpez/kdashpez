## Legacy
It was in fifth grade when my teacher introduced very thought-provoking topics. At the time, I probably didn't take them as seriously, but they have certainly resonated with me up to this day. My teacher spoke about how life is short and that we should seize the day (I hadn't watched Dead Poets Society at that point in time). He asked us what would we leave behind on this after we are gone. He wanted us to think about our *legacy*. I was sure it wasn't exactly about being famous, but about the impact that you have made and the experience you gain with the time that you are alive.

Fifth grade was also the first time that I highly interested in my family's ancestry since that was the first time I was introduced to the topic of genealogy. My parents, being from the Philippines, have no extensive recorded history of what my family has really done. This website is an attempt to have some written record of what I've done and the thoughts that I have (because you can't turn off the Internet, right?). Also, making websites is super fun, amirite?

Hmm, time for a cliche...This is only the beginning.
