## Legacy
It was in fifth grade when my teacher introduced very thought-provoking topics. 
This may very well have been the first time, at least that I was conscious of it, of my own existence. 
At the time, I probably didn't take them as seriously, but they have certainly resonated with me up to 
this day. My teacher spoke about how life is short and that we should seize the day (I hadn't watched 
Dead Poets Society at that point in time). "Carpe diem," he said to us. It had that extra bit of cool 
just because it was in Latin.
He asked us what would we leave behind after we are gone. He wanted us to think about our *legacy*. 
I was sure it wasn't exactly about being famous or leaving some form of object or possession that people will remember you by, but about the impact that you have made and the experience you gain with the time that you are alive.

I tried to think about this concept and what I would make out of my legacy. I can't remember what fifth-grade me was going to do with her legacy. However, the idea did stay with me. Reflecting upon it now, 
I'd like to think that I'm getting closer to that idea of trying to do something impactful with my life.
And perhaps, the simplest idea I have of that is to produce more than I consume. I thoroughly enjoy 
music, it's an integral part of my life. I hope not only to consume it, but actually make some music 
of my own one day. I also hope to do the same with film. Even more so, I think about this world and all the technology that has been developed. I would like to contribute to the advancement of that as well. Might I say (autonomous vehicles ;) )...

While I still don't have a complete answer to what my legacy encompasses, I'd like to think that I 
should at least keep a record of what I did. That's what this website is for. Maybe my grandchildren 
could figure out some stuff about me (and that would be cool (assuming they would be interested in 21st century millennial history)). Also, making websites are fun, amirite?
 
Hmm, time for a cliche...This is only the beginning.
