# Acid Rap by Chance the Rapper
I don't even listen to rap, man. But here goes, have a listen with me:
<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/5278265&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

### Good Ass Intro
This is actually a pretty good ass introduction. It's upbeat and catchy. We get a good taste of Chance's ad-libs (but tbh, it's kind of annoying after a while...but it's classic Chance). At the end, I really like that binaural effect.
Score: 8/10
