# Roy Pablo EP by Boy Pablo
Release Date: 05.19.2017

Genre Tags: indie rock, indie pop

Ah yes, a YouTube recommendation engine star (thank you machine learning)...Here's Boy Pablo and his EP: Roy Pablo. I will say that I do listen to indie rock/pop the most out of any genre so there's gonna be some bias here (more on being objective in music reviews later).

### Yeah(Fantisizing)
Right off the bat, we hear the dreamy guitar, emphasized by the echo and reverb.The second section of the song just kind of drifts away (seems kind of aimless...but I think that's the point of the song).

Score: 7/10

### Everytime
Not going to lie, this music video is so awkward it's great. I kind of want to give it a 10/10 just because of that.

On a more serious note, this song will probably resonate with a lot of millennials. I just have that feeling. Not sure if song is more about unrequited love than anything. There's a bluesy riff around 1:33 which is quite good. Lyric reversal at the end is also notable. She was focused on him the whole time, that she doesn't really know herself (maaayyybeeee???).

Score: 8/10

### Dance, Baby!
More unrequited love. Chorus is catchy, really does make me want to dance. Yep, more Internet Age references...reel in those millennials, man. Loneliness. Oh god, air horn...Y?

Score: 8 (for catchy chorus) - 0.5 (for airhorn) = 7.5/10

### imreallytiredthisdaysucks
I feel like this is a lazy version of Yeah(Fantisizing). I'm sure this is track is not going to be as popular as the previous ones, because it was literally about the day sucking. Idk, maybe Pablo was having a bad day? Maybe that's why this song is in the middle?

Score: 5/10

### ur phone
I feel u dude. Even the noisy ending pays homage to the whole "phone" idea. Kinda cool, but that's about it.

Score: 4/10

### Ready / Problems
This is probably the best of the slower songs. Super moody. Instrumentation in the second half does better than the first. Haunting.

Score: 7/10

## Final Thots
Boy Pablo sort of uses the same kind of style throughout the album, which makes it consistent but there isn't much diversity. Not sure how much diversity an up and coming artist is supposed to show? As far as the thematic element of this whole EP, it's covered pretty well. The EP touches on different aspects of dating/romantic struggles.
The momentum from the beginning of the EP kind of dies off into the slow songs, but the last song kind of picks it back up. Overall, not a bad EP.
And what have we learned? If you want to become famous, pray to the YouTube machine learning algorithm gods and also make some quality music that people can relate to (probably).
