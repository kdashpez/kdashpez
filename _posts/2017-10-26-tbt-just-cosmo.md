# Just Cosmo EP by Cosmo Pyke
Release Date: 02.24.2017

Genre Tags: alternative r&b, chill rap, hipster shit

Just an initial opinion of Cosmo Pyke: man this shit is good but wtf is the genre??? It's really hard to describe, but it's really unique. I don't think I've heard anything like this before. It's not quite rap, it's not quite r&b, not quite jazz, not quite blues... It's kind of all of that and also not.

Great Dane was the first song that I listened to, the full version on YouTube, with the monologue at the beginning. I really liked that addition, it felt a little more emotional.

### Wish You Were Gone
The beginning, slow section of this song transitions beautifully into the faster-paced, second section of the song. This second section also has some groove jazz drums, especially with this triplet (around 2:32): "so... -fuck- -ing- bad-", then silence. Even the sample at the end of this song is quite eerie.

Score: 8/10 

### Chronic Sunshine
Ooh man, the chorus to this one is quite catchy. Even the phrase "chronic sunshine" itself, this man has a way with words. The rapping section is additionally smooth.

Score: 7.5/10

### After School Club
For a second, I thought I was listening to Coldplay just by the lead vocal. I'm feeling slight funk groove and then it goes into a smooth rock vibe. This guy is like a musical chemist who can just mix whatever genres he wants and produces such good music.

Score: 7/10

### Social Sites
Dang this is such a #sadboiz2017 song. 

Score: 7/10

### Great Dane
The music video for this one is pretty good:

The lyrics in this song are one of it's strongest points. Cosmo has such great flow: 
>I’m still developing
>Enveloped in the elephant of the room I’m already in
>I don’t give fuck
>It’s irrelevant

This song is hauntingly beautiful.

Score: 9.5/10

### Final Thoughts
This dude has some serious TALENT. I feel like there aren't too many modern artists who try to combine as many genres as artfully or skillfully as this guy. His songs overflow with emotion. This EP is quite unique and I highly appreciate it.
