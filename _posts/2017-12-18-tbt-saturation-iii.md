# Saturation III by BROCKHAMPTON
Release Date: 12.15.2017

Genre Tags: hip-hop, rap, alternative rap, pop, all-american, goodassmusic

Just for a little bit of context: this album is what we would thought was going to be BROCKHAMPTON's, the "all-American boy band", final album. This comes as a shock since this group pushed out two albums full of great production quality. This review will be a collaboration between
Jeremy and I, we'll present both of our sides for this track by track review. Sit back, relax, plug in your headphones and listen to BROCKHAMPTON'S third installment, SATURATION III.

### BOOGIE

KAT: This song kicks through the album like the Kool-Aid man busting through the
wall. It makes an intense statement, it's like "YO DUDE THIS IS SATURATION III, ARE YOU READY?" Now this song does lean more toward a poppy dance song, but does not reflect the tone of the entire album.

JEREMY: Although this is the first track on the album, it feels like a victory lap for the entire SATURATION trilogy.

### ZIPPER

KAT: Alright, seriously...this is my fav track on this album. The light hi-hats freaking drive this song like a train chugging through, carrying the lyrics on it along with it. The beginning of this track are lightly reminiscent of baroque music, as if it were modernized (I'm probably just saying this because of the violin-ish sound).


JEREMY: There's so much going on here. From the cheeky ragtime piano loop, to the sirens blaring on the hook, and the flat out infectious energy the vocalists bring to the track. This easily stands out as one of the best tracks on the album. Also, shoutouts to Melon Head.

### JOHNNY

KAT: The opening monologue with the different voices overlapped is a really interesting start to this song. I also really like the drifting saxophone throughout this song, kinda makes it feel classy.

JEREMY: This is one of the more personal tracks from Brockhampton. On it, the band members take turns sharing their hardships and woes over a melancholy beat. I found Joba's verse to be the most notable of the bunch. It's deeply genuine and relatable. Overall, this is a solid track. I only wish for two things. That the saxophone played a larger role; and that Kevin ends up getting Harry Styles' phone number.

### LIQUID

KAT: This song probably makes the weakest impact of the songs heard so far. Yaaawn, next.

JEREMY: On this track the MCs interlace their verses in a manner reminiscent of Run the Jewels, but with an entirely different tone. Vocals are laid out over an intricately layered instrumental that changes dramatically over the song's short duration.

### CINEMA 1 / CINEMA 2 / CINEMA 3

KAT: As far as all the cinema tracks, idk Spanish that well bro. But I can say, that I
do appreciate this storytelling aspect that BH has sandwiched in every SATURATION album.

JEREMY:

### STUPID

KAT: You're gonna have the chorus stuck in your head, plain and simple. This song also
reminds me of FAKE from SATURATION.

JEREMY: Brockhampton continues to impress with their level of production. This bangs so hard I get stank face everytime I hear it. Definitely the catchiest hook on the album.

### BLEACH

KAT: This song is disorienting. But a good disorienting. BH tries to counterbalance this with smooth, clean vocals in the chorus. Ultimately, it's a weird attempt at experimental R&amp;B?
This song is literally just OK to me. Not my most favorite song of this album, but it's worth a listen.

JEREMY: This is perhaps the most beautiful track on the album, maybe even the entire SATURATION series. Ryan Beatty makes a guest appearance and delivers a very emotional chorus while the other lyrics are mostly somber and focus on remorse and missed opportunities. That is until yet another beat switch up takes place towards the end and the song ends on a more optimistic note.

### ALASKA

KAT: This song is all about changes. The changes that these artists are experiencing. By the
time Matt Champion comes on, you can really feel this song take a dip in the mood, to
a sadder region of feels.

JEREMY: This track starts off with a simple beat as Ameer Vann and Kevin Abstract rap and sing about their newfound success. Gradually, strings are introduced that continue on at at a marching tempo. Eventually a crescendo of G-funk synths transition into a bridge with haunting vocals.

### HOTTIE

KAT: This might not be the best track of the whole album. But it does sink a point into BH's diversity cup. The feeling of this song is pretty different from the previous ones. It's a really good mellow break; this song makes me feel like it has some roots in indie rock/pop even. You can hear it in the chorus. I wanna know where the party at.

JEREMY: Brockhampton showcase their range on this indie pop jam which is just overflowing with good vibes. It's hard to think of anything but sunshine and butterflies while this one plays. Also, it seems that every hook Kevin delivers takes permanent residence in my head. He kills it every time. The group as a whole refuses to settle on one genre. And I hope they never do, because they've shown that they can execute any style at the highest level.

### CINEMA 2
(See above.)

### SISTER/NATION

KAT: When I listen to this song, I envision these artists in a dark, empty room with a single light hanging above, doing slam poetry and then suddenly these neon lights light up the room when the robotic voice comes on.

Oh hello cinema dude, how's it going?

WAOW, are we listening to vaporwave electronic music now? The break starting at 1:15
is one of the highlights of this song. BROCKHAMPTON transports us to
different worlds with these different phases in this song. The heavy synth in this song
is sort of our anchor line and helps us through this song.

JEREMY: This two part song starts out aggressive and kinetic. I love Merlyn's intro and the addictive repetition of "yeah, yeah, yeah." The beat is just so violent, industrial, and chaotic; almost as if this were a collaboration with the Death Grips. The way Matt Champion comes in on the third verse gives me heart palpitations. His flow perfectly matches the track's frenetic pace. Midway through, the song abruptly slows down and transitions into an atmospheric, synth-heavy reflection of the band member's pasts. Each part is very different from the other, but they're combined in a way that makes complete sense. The energy on the SISTER alone makes this one of my favorite tracks, and the expert composition of the two only adds to it.

### RENTAL

KAT: The bass kinda reminds me of STUPID just a little bit and mainstream hip-hop. As far as BH's diversity so far, I don't think track really contributes to that. Chorus is catchy, so gonna give them that. Probably gonna say skip, you're not missing much.

JEREMY: I'm on the fence with this one. Compared to the other tracks this one feels like it's playing it safe. While I could see it being a highlight on your average rap album, I've come to expect more from this project. That said, it has yet another hook from Kevin that's guaranteed to get stuck in your head, head, head, head, head, head, head.

### STAINS

KAT: This song is really just kind of a background night driving song to me. The last 30
seconds are probably the only part of this song that I like.

JEREMY: Ameer Vann starts this track off with a lyrical flow that we're not used to hearing from him. This is one of the few Brockhampton songs which Kevin Abstract doesn't appear on. His absence is filled by some smooth vocals from Joba and excellent performances from Matt and Dom as they reflect on fame and what could have been. Overall, I think this is an interesting song and I like the way they jokingly make reference to criticisms that are often lodged at them.

### CINEMA 3
(See above.)

### TEAM

KAT: Ahahah, the first part of the song literally reminds me of some emo/pop punk ballad. Now,
for the second part of the song...reminds me more of Pink Floyd? And YES, TEAM does lead
into HEAT.

## Final Thots

Since we didn't individually rate each track, we're gonna give our top picks and final comments on the entire album.

KAT: In terms of diversity, production value and tracks that I feel contribute to the album as a whole, I'm going to pick *ZIPPER*, *SISTER/NATION*, and *STUPID*. Personal favs are BOOGIE, ZIPPER, and HOTTIE (cause I'm an indie-pop-rock head).
Overall, I freaking love this album as a whole. These albums have demonstrated their
diversity as artists. I think that artists should try to stretch their limits as much
as possible and try to diversify their tracks. Artists without a lot of diversity tend
to corner themselves into a genre of complacency. The challenge of diversity is the fear of the loss of identity of the band as a whole. But BROCKHAMPTON has certainly proven their style which is what makes listening to their music really enjoyable and keeps things fresh. They make a statement with each track and they tell a story with the entire album. It's cohesive, despite having varying genres and definitely worth a listen.
