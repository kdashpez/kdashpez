# Saturation III by BROCKHAMPTON
Release Date: 12.15.2017

Genre Tags: hip-hop, rap, alternative rap, pop, all-american, goodassmusic

Just for a little bit of context: this album is what we would thought was going to be BROCKHAMPTON's, the "all-American boy band", final album. This comes as a shock since this group pushed out two albums full of great production quality. This review will be a collaboration between
Jeremy and I, we'll present both of our sides for this track by track review. Sit back, relax, plug in your headphones and listen to BROCKHAMPTON'S third installment, SATURATION III.

### BOOGIE

KAT: This song kicks through the album like the Kool-Aid man busting through the
wall. It makes an intense statement, it's like "YO DUDE THIS IS SATURATION III, ARE YOU READY?" Now this song does lean more toward a poppy dance song, but does not reflect the tone of the entire album, it hypes up the listener for the tracks to come.

JEREMY: I wasn't feeling this one at first, but it quickly grew on me. It starts with a bang and while it's only the first track on the album, it feels like a victory lap for the entire SATURATION trilogy.

### ZIPPER

KAT: Alright, seriously...this is my fav track on this album. The light hi-hats freaking drive this song like a train chugging through, carrying the lyrics on it along with it. The beginning of this track are lightly reminiscent of baroque music, as if it were modernized (I'm probably just saying this because of the violin-ish sound).


JEREMY: There's so much going on here. From the cheeky ragtime piano loop, to the sirens blaring on the hook, and the flat out infectious energy the vocalists bring to the track. This easily stands out as one of the best tracks on the album. Also, shoutouts to Melon Head.

### JOHNNY

KAT: The opening monologue with the different voices overlapped is a really interesting start to this song. I also really like the drifting saxophone throughout this song, kinda makes it feel classy.

JEREMY: This is one of the more personal tracks from Brockhampton. On it, the band members take turns sharing their hardships and woes over a melancholy beat. I found Joba's verse to be the most notable of the bunch. It's deeply genuine and relatable. Overall, this is a solid track. I only wish for two things. That the saxophone played a larger role on this track; and that Kevin ends up getting Harry's phone number.

### LIQUID

KAT: This song probably makes the weakest impact of the songs heard so far. Yaaawn, next.

JEREMY: I have to disagree with Kat here. To start, the transition from JOHNNY into LIQUID is seamless. On it, the MCs interlace their verses in a way that's reminiscent of Run the Jewels, but with an entirely different tone. Vocals are laid out over an intricately layered instrumental that changes dramatically over time. It's amazing how much is accomplished in the short 88 second runtime of this track.

KAT: Alright, Jeremy...with further listening, I can agree that the transition from JOHNNY to LIQUID is definitely seamless. The arpeggiated piano chord in the background makes this song feel really haunting and it helps make the connection between each member's verses. The band plays on this theme of being nostalgic and transitioning from their ordinary lives to their newfound fame.

### CINEMA 1 / CINEMA 2 / CINEMA 3

KAT: As far as all the cinema tracks, idk Spanish that well bro. But I can say, that I
do appreciate this storytelling aspect that BH has sandwiched in every SATURATION album. I think I'mma let Jeremy do the analysis on this one.

JEREMY: These interludes are mostly spoken word, but there is some beautiful orchestral music in the background. Unfortunately, my high school Spanish did not prepare me well enough to understand most of what Robert had to say, but I did look at the translations put together by the Rap Genius community. In the first CINEMA, Robert reflects on the fun he's had living with the band and how he misses his family. CINEMA 2 is more about his reclusive tendencies. The music in this one reminds me of the intro to Demon Days by the Gorillaz in many ways. Finally, there's CINEMA 3, a prayer to God asking for hope and guidance. I found it really touching, even though I'm not a religious person. I'm not sure if these do much for me by themselves, but they certainly add a lot of character to the album. There also seems to be a progression to the interludes throughout the trilogy. In SATURATION they were labeled skits, then scenes in SATURATION II, and now cinemas. Perhaps an indication of the band's intentions.

### STUPID

KAT: You're gonna have the chorus stuck in your head, plain and simple. This song also
reminds me of FAKE from SATURATION.

JEREMY: Brockhampton continue to impress with their level of production. The instrumental is simply intoxicating. Merlyn's entrance is massive and grimy in all the right ways. I still get a stupid grin on my face everytime the beat drops. This definitely has the catchiest hook on the album. It's an impossible task not to sing along with it.

### BLEACH

KAT: This song is disorienting. But a good disorienting. BH tries to counterbalance this with smooth, clean vocals in the chorus. Ultimately, it's a weird attempt at experimental R&amp;B?
This song is not an easy listen. At the beginning, it almost feels like it's a broken record. Not my most favorite song of this album, but it's worth a listen.

JEREMY: This is perhaps the most beautiful track on the album, maybe even the entire SATURATION series. Ryan Beatty makes a guest appearance and delivers a very emotional chorus while the other lyrics are mostly somber and focus on remorse and missed opportunities. Reversed guitar strums play out in the background until a beat switch up takes place towards the end and the song closes on a more optimistic note. I can't say enough good things about this one.

KAT: I'm just shook from the reversed guitar, it makes me confused (laughing crying emoji).

### ALASKA

KAT: This song is all about changes. The changes that these artists are experiencing. By the
time Matt Champion comes on, you can really feel this song take a dip in the mood, to
a sadder region of feels.

JEREMY: This track starts off with a simple beat as Ameer Vann and Kevin Abstract rap and sing about their newfound success. Gradually, strings are introduced that continue on at at a marching tempo. Eventually a crescendo of G-funk synths transition into a bridge with haunting vocals. I really like how this track evolves.

### HOTTIE

KAT: This might not be the best track of the whole album. But it does sink a point into BH's diversity cup. The feeling of this song is pretty different from the previous ones. It's a really good mellow break; this song makes me feel like it has some roots in indie rock/pop even. You can hear it in the chorus. I wanna know where the party at.

JEREMY: Brockhampton showcase their range on this indie pop jam which is just overflowing with good vibes. It's hard to think of anything but sunshine and butterflies while this one plays. Also, it seems that every hook Kevin delivers takes permanent residence in my head. He kills it every time. The group as a whole refuses to settle on one genre. And I hope they never do, because they've shown that they can execute any style at the highest level.

### CINEMA 2
(See above.)

### SISTER/NATION

KAT: When I listen to this song, I envision these artists in a dark, empty room with a single light hanging above, doing slam poetry and then suddenly these neon lights light up the room when the robotic voice comes on.

Oh hello cinema dude, how's it going?

WAOW, are we listening to vaporwave electronic music now? The break starting at 1:15
is one of the highlights of this song. BROCKHAMPTON transports us to
different worlds with these different phases in this song. The heavy synth in this song
is sort of our anchor line and helps us through this song.

JEREMY: This two part song starts out aggressive and kinetic. I love Merlyn's intro and the addictive repetition of "yeah, yeah, yeah." The beat is just so violent, industrial, and chaotic; almost as if this were a collaboration with the Death Grips. The way Matt Champion comes in on the third verse gives me heart palpitations. His flow perfectly matches the track's frenetic pace. Midway through, the song abruptly slows down and transitions into an atmospheric, synth-heavy reflection of the band member's pasts. Each part is very different from the other, but they're combined in a way that makes complete sense. The energy on the SISTER alone makes this one of my favorite tracks, and the expert composition of the two only adds to it.

### RENTAL

KAT: The bass kinda reminds me of STUPID just a little bit and mainstream hip-hop. As far as BH's diversity so far, I don't think track really contributes to that. Chorus is catchy, so gonna give them that. Probably gonna say skip, you're not missing much.

JEREMY: I'm on the fence with this one. Compared to the other tracks this one feels like it's playing it safe. While I could see it being a highlight on other albums album, I've come to expect more from this project. That said, it has yet another stellar hook from Kevin. It's guaranteed to get stuck in your head, head, head, head, head, head, head.

### STAINS

KAT: This song is really just kind of a background night driving song to me. The last 30
seconds are probably the only part of this song that I like.

JEREMY: Ameer Vann starts this track off with a lyrical flow that we're not used to hearing from him. This is one of the few Brockhampton songs which Kevin Abstract doesn't appear on. His absence is filled by some smooth vocals from Joba and excellent performances from Matt and Dom as they reflect on fame and what could have been. Overall, I think this is an interesting song and I like the way they jokingly make reference to criticisms that are often lodged at them.

### CINEMA 3
(See above.)

### TEAM

KAT: Ahahah, the first part of the song literally reminds me of some emo/pop punk ballad. Now,
for the second part of the song...reminds me more of Pink Floyd? And YES, TEAM does lead
into HEAT.

JEREMY: This is another two-parter. The first part is a bittersweet ballad from Bearface where he's the other man in a relationship. It features only his angelic voice and some electric guitar. I'm getting serious Frank Ocean vibes here. After some silence, part two kicks off with drums, funky guitar riffs, and unique rap verses from the usual suspects. I like the way Ameer and Kevin go back and forth. Both Dom and Matt come in and manage to say a lot in just a few bars each. I also thought it was clever the way the naming convention reverts back to the one used on the first SATURATION. The gif says it all.

## Final Thots

Since we didn't individually rate each track, we're gonna give our top picks and final comments on the entire album.

KAT: In terms of diversity, production value and tracks that I feel contribute to the album as a whole, I'm going to pick **ZIPPER**, **SISTER/NATION**, and **STUPID**. Personal favs are BOOGIE, ZIPPER, and HOTTIE (cause I'm an indie-pop-rock head).
Overall, I freaking love this album as a whole. These albums have demonstrated their
diversity as artists. I think that artists should try to stretch their limits as much
as possible and try to diversify their tracks. Artists without a lot of diversity tend
to corner themselves into a genre of complacency. The challenge of diversity is the fear of the loss of identity of the band as a whole. But BROCKHAMPTON has certainly proven their style which is what makes listening to their music really enjoyable and keeps things fresh. They make a statement with each track and they tell a story with the entire album. It's cohesive, despite having varying genres and definitely worth a listen.

JEREMY: Brockhampton represents a wide array of perspectives, and that's well represented in this project. Each song is unique and diverse, yet arranged in a way that feels balanced. Of course, some common Brockhampton motifs crop up: sexuality, drugs, angst; but these topics are explored in new and different ways. All of this is accomplished with consistently excellent production and vocal performances. Standouts for me include most of the album, but if I had to pick just a few I would choose **BLEACH**, **ZIPPER**, and **STUPID**. SATURATION III is more than a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Between its eclectic tracklist, boundless energy, and unique sound, I think it should be regarded as a masterpiece. The collective set out with the ambitious goal of redefining pop music. While that might seem like a ridiculous claim to many, they've put in the effort to do just that. Three albums have been released in half a year and there's already a fourth on the way. Personally, I couldn’t be more excited to see what comes next from "the Internet's first boy band."
