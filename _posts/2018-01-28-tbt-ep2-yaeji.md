# EP2 by yaeji
Release Date: 11.03.2017

Genre Tags: dance, electronic, trance, korean, low-key ASMR

Yaeji is a rising Korean-American artist reigning from New York. She combines electronic house music with subtle rap.

Fun fact: there's this effect called autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), which basically means that you get shivers or similar
physical responses from hearing certain sounds, not necessarily music. Soft, whispery voices triggers ASMR. Soft, whispery voices +
hypnotizing 808 beats = euphoria. Refer to [r/ASMR](http://reddit.com/r/ASMR) for more euphoria inducing sounds.

### feelings change

Enter the yaeji dreamland. The way she sings the lyrics to this song is interesting...she makes it feel like one long sentence, repeated twice.
> Speaking like breathing, it's easy

I suppose speaking like breathing is kind of how this song is structured, all of the words aren't more than two syllables. It definitely feels like
she's kinda speaking like breathing. Tbh man, it just makes me confused. Where the commas should go!? It sounds like listening to an audio
version of [Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero-Tolerance Approach to Punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eats,_Shoots_%26_Leaves).

Score: 6/10

### raingurl

House music bias incoming (!!!). I was absolutely obsessed with this song. Yaeji has crafted a trance-like song without committing fully to the trance recipe. The song captures the trace feel without the runtime of a trance song; bite-sized trance, if you will. The minimalism of this track and the use of echo paradoxically gives this song depth. The bass is extremely fat with this one and the chorus is unbelievably catchy. This song is easily the best song on this EP and I can easily play this song over and over and over; I really just want to make it rain gurl, make it rain.

Score: 9/10

### drink i'm sippin on

I felt some slight Daft Punk's "One More Time" Music's got me feeling so free in this one. This song is a fine addition to this EP. This track following
raingurl makes sense since we need to take a slight break from the bumpin' house song and reflect upon how happy we are, since the music's got us feeling so
free.

Score: 7/10

### after that

Immediately, we hear some dissonant notes, it makes the song feel almost alien. The tone of the song feels slower and darker than the rest of the songs. This song is most likely the most forgettable song of this EP, but it could be worth at least one listen.

Score: 5/10

### passionfruit

The beginning sounds like the beginning of a Pogo song. I'm not a **huge** Drake fan, so there's no bias there (though Hotline Bling and Fake Love are bangers). As for this cover, I can hear the mild autotune and I'm more accepting of it than in other songs. Yaeji has incorporated her classic trancey style in this cover, which is a job well done. However, I would definitely have rather heard another original than a cover or nothing at all. This song is an average ending to this EP.

Score: 6/10

## Final Thoughts:

> yaeji is baeji.

She captures the essence of 90's house music interleaved with modern, minimal EDM and subtle Korean rapping. I also want to give a mild shout-out to the naming convention of this EP, I love the use of lower-case on these titles (I understand that's a weird thing to like, but hey I'm just being me and I like a e s t h e t i c).

raingurl takes the cake for me and that allows me to call her baeji.

**Bonus Round**: Not on this EP but "Guap" is definitely worth a listen.
