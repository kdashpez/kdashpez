=== EXCELLENT ALBUM ALERT ===

*Disclaimer: this is the first full album that I've heard from Tyler. Tbh, the only song that I was really familiar with was Tamale. Moving forward from that, this album is very much not like Tamale.*<br/>

### Foreword

Def some slight bias here since I'm a fan of Rex Orange County. I didn't even know that he did two tracks with Tyler. Overall, this song is pretty introspective. Rex adds the sultriness to this song.

Score: 8/10

### Where This Flower Blooms

The bridge on this song is super catchy.
> I rock, I roll, I bloom, I glow

Score: 9/10

### Sometimes...

This radio narrator/dj section is p good.

Score: 8/10 for an interlude

### See You Again

Oh boy, I think it would be unfair to review this song for undisclosed reasons.

----> Romantic/Cute/Squishy as AF lyrics incoming
> Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision
> **I wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind**

I am seriously in love with this line. The romantic cheese levels are quite high, but it works so well as a prelude to Kali's part.

> Can I get a kiss?
> And can you make it last forever?
> I said I'm 'bout to go to to war
> And I don't know if I'ma see you again

This whole song has some pretty sentimental lines.

Score: âˆž/10

### Who Dat Boy

The mood shift from See You Again is a bit off-putting. This song transitions into a very manic, horror feel with the crescendo on these violins. However, this song as it is can be seen

Score: 8/10

### Pothole
This song grooves, also the thing about the sheep was deep.

Score: 7.5/10

### Garden Shed

Score: 8.5/10

### Boredom
Oh hey, it's Rex again. This song sounded better live. Sorry, Rex, you make this song sound a bit weird. The warpiness of Rex's voice kind of throws the song off mildly. However, the drums are pretty groovy.

Overall, there's a lot going on in this song and it's the best of this album in terms of the composition. Boredom is treated as a noun,

Score: 9/10

### I Ain't Got Time!

The sample at the beginning of this song is "Introduction" by Bel-Sha-Zaar, Tommy Genapopoluis and The Grecian Knights. The song immediately reminds me of is "Deee-Lite" by Groove is in the Heart. For some reason, it puts me in some Egyptian mood as well.

Quite exemplary use of skrrrt.

Score: 9/10

### 911 / Mr. Lonely

(It would definitely be unfair to review this song without any bias at all. (\*ahem\* Ken))

Score: Elon Musk / 10

### Droppin' Seeds

This song pretty much slipped past me.

Score: 5/10

### November

I really like the spoken word in this one.

Score: 8/10

### Glitter

Despite the cheesy lyrics, this song feels pretty heartfelt. The bells in this song complement the glitter feel, just that sparkly happiness. The breakdown digresses into some insecurities he has about himself and his relationship with person of interest. And then theres this extra part at the end of the voicemail that shows his emotional distress. #relatable

Score: 9/10 (idgaf needledrop, this song is good)

### Enjoy Right Now, Today

This purely instrumental song caps off the album nicely. It has that feel of a march with its crisp snare drum beat, which leads into the groovy midsection. After being thrown on an emotional rollercoaster throughout this album, this song provides that hopeful solace: that at least you can enjoy right now, today.

Score: 8/10

## Final Thoughts

Quick commentary before my final thoughts: the overall use of synth in this album is really good.<br/>

Tyler isn't a great singer but it still works really well. It really isn't off-putting; if anything it gives personality to the album. The voicemail and radio themes contribute a sort of lo-fi feel. There's the overall theme of relationships and introspection.

Overall, this album is solid AF.
