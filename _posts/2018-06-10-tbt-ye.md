Katherine - Initial thoughts: man, what a meme-able album cover. This album cover is just screaming to be memed. I'm not well versed in the Kanye world but I'm going to keep it like that for this review. I haven't listened to Graduation completely, or any of his other albums for that matter. Secondly, disclaimer: Ken made me review this, not that I don't like being made to do reviews.

### I Thought About Killing You

Katherine - Act I: the song's long monologue.
> But sometimes I think really bad things <br>
> Really, really, really bad things

Act II:

### Yikes

Katherine -

### All Mine

Katherine - Jeremih's parts are the catchiest for sure. That "medulla oblongata" part and the part that follows is (100 emoji) (fire emoji). The low, almost organ-like introduction makes this song feel sorta spooky.

### Wouldn't Leave


### No Mistakes

### Ghost Town
Katherine - I *LOVE* the intro to this one. I think the overall message of this song is pretty powerful.


### Violent Crimes


## Final Thots
Katherine: My top picks for this album are "Ghost Town" and "All Mine", in that order. Can I just say I just wanted a "serious" version of "Lift Yourself" but it's okay. Poopidy scoop.

Katherine: I guess I have to listen to the other albums now.
