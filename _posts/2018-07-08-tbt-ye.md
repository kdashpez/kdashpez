Ken: Nowadays, it appears that Kanye has taken on the role of a creative visionary/director
rather than confining himself as a producer/rapper. This is inevitable as he explores
more ways to express himself as an artist: music (Producer, songwriter, and rapper),
fashion (Yeezy Szn), twitter rants (@kanyewest), and possibly film (Short film for his
upcoming collaboration album with Kid Cudi). I have always been interested in the
different artistic outlets Kanye uses to express himself.
After abruptly canceling The Life of Pablo tour, Kanye West remained relatively quiet
and away from the media's attention. However, this did not last forever as Kanye
became the center of controversies over the past months for saying "Slavery was a
choice", declaring support for US president Donald Trump, and wearing a "Make
America Great Again" hat. Nevertheless, the wait is over and Kanye is back with his
eighth, Wyoming-produced studio album that focuses on his mental health and family
life.

Katherine: Man, what a meme-able album cover. This album cover is just screaming to be memed. I'm not well versed in the Kanye world but I'm going to keep it like that for this review. I haven't listened to Graduation completely, or any of his other albums for that matter. Secondly, disclaimer: Ken made me review this, not that I don't like being made to do reviews. He’ll probably have a better perspective of this album relative to Kanye’s other works.

This album is a pretty short one, running for only 23 mins. Stylistically, I think these shorter albums have a smaller chance of containing “filler” tracks. This leaves the artist to tighten the focus of the entire album. Now, onto the album...

### I Thought About Killing You

Katherine: Act I: this song's long, introductory monologue is his soliloquy to himself. The words recited by the warped voice reveals another layer to what he wants to convey. The change in pitch to a deeper voice reflects his deep, inner thoughts. These thoughts are probably hard to admit. He worries about the perception of talking about these things.
>I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good To compensate it so it doesn't come off bad <br/>
> But sometimes I think really bad things <br/>
> Really, really, really bad things
“Premeditated murder”, said again in this low, deep voice, are the parting words of the first section of this song.

Act II: The soliloquy ends and he switches topics at the mark of a single, bass beat. The song slowly introduces percussive instruments which helps it transition into a more upbeat tempo. In the previous section, the focus was more reflective and introspective. In this section, we focus more on his actions and his outrospective thoughts.

Ken: The track begins with "The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest",
which seems too good to not be a reference to "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy".
This is possibly addressing Kanye's bipolar disorder which was explicitly mentioned on
the album cover. This line is part of a monologue of Kanye speaking over a repeated,
droning beat that sounds like heavily processed vocal. This monologue threw me off a
bit as it's more than a spoken speech - it actually has a verse-chorus-verse structure
and lasts over 2 minutes . And for a moment, I was led to believe the entire album will
be Kanye speaking into a mic instead of rapping (Good thing that wasn't the case lol).
More than half way through the song, the beat transitions into this minimalist, eerie
beat that reminds me of Pusha T's "If You Know You Know". This would make some
sense since Kanye produced both "Ye" and "Daytona".
It is interesting for Kanye to start off the album with a monologue that would most
people off. This really forces the listener to focus on what Kanye has to say. I was
tempted to believe the "You" in the song refers to the fanbase, but upon further
reflection I do not think it has to be a literal human figure at all. Since the overall
album revolves around Kanye growing as a person for the better and being more self-aware,
the "You" may very well refer to a human flaw Kanye recognized in himself.

### Yikes

Katherine - Kanye has a very strong superhero theme going on. In the previous the previous song,

Ken - On this song we see Kanye swings back and forth between the highs and lows of his
bipolar disorder. It almost seems as if there are different Kanye's throughout the
song: the rapping-Kanye is aggressive and raw, while the singing-Kanye is self-aware
and worried of his maniacal outbursts. The flow on this song is a bit simplistic and not
terribly interesting, although Kanye's delivery and tone do make me feel like I'm
getting inside the head of a lunatic.

### All Mine

Ken - The structure of this song is very straightforward: chorus-verse-chorus-verse-chorus.
Kanye makes it clear that he is asserting his sexual desire and dominance in All Mine. I
am not sure how I feel about some of the bars on here, such as "None of us would be
here without cum" and "I love your titties 'cause they prove I can focus on two things
at once". It reminds me of Kanye rapping about bleached assholes in Father Stretch
My Hands Pt. 1 on the last album. As of now I am definitely leaning more towards
calling these bars as whack because I still cringe a little on the inside when I hear
those lines. One highlight on this song, however, is definitely the distorted, blown-out
"Ayy" sound effect in the background.

Katherine - Jeremih's parts are the catchiest for sure. That "medulla oblongata" part and the part that follows is (100 emoji) (fire emoji). The low, almost organ-like introduction makes this song feel sorta spooky.

### Wouldn't Leave

Katherine -

Ken - I really enjoy all the beautiful singing on this song, especially the chorus with
PARTYNEXTDOOR. Throughout the song, we hear this subtle, glittering keyboard
sound effect that adds a gentle touch to the mood. The slow and soothing drum
pattern sounds very organic and adds that much more honesty to what Kanye is
saying. The stark contrast between the tone and message of the last song makes
Wouldn't Leave that much more impactful.

### No Mistakes

Katherine -

Ken - This song only has one verse and is by far the shortest song on this album. In this song
Kanye addresses his resurgence as an artist after his mental breakdown during the
2016 tour. This was a dark period of time where Kanye was surrounded by
controversies (More than usual, I guess), with many news outlets claiming that he was
going bankrupt. Kid Cudi singing the hook is absolutely infectious and my personal
favorite on his album. Kanye's vocal performance is punchy, to-the-point, and
effective. My favorite bars are the ones where he throws shade at Drake
(Supposedly?) and compares himself to hip-hop legend Ice Cube. To me this song feels
like Kanye's triumphs as an artist, as in no matter how hard he falls he will always
come back stronger.

### Ghost Town

Katherine - I *LOVE* the intro to this one. Beginning with the clanky, bright piano sample. The sample mentions “Someday I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown.” I think the overall message of this song is pretty powerful. Some of what Kanye says is mildly mumbled. This is a pretty heartfelt song...

Ken - Personally, I think the song is about Kanye reflecting on the consequences of his self -destructing behaviours. In his verse, Kanye comes off as very emotional and personal,
and he is almost singing at certain times. I really dig the use of guitar in this song - it
helps the track to build up an epic feeling for the listener, especially in the last verse.
At first I could not take the song too seriously because of the line about "[putting] my
hands on the stove", but now I see it as describing a vulnerable feeling that most of us
can relate to - being hurt so deeply that you go numb and lose touch with reality. On
another note, I am still not sure what the off-beat laser sound is all about and it still
throws me off whenever I listen to the song.

### Violent Crimes

Katherine -

Ken - As a closer, we get a heartwarming track about Kanye's change in perspectives on
women and family life. There is nothing braggadocious in this track. This isn't the first
time Kanye raps about how having a daughter will change a man's perspectives on
women; In "We Major", Kanye raps "Until you have a daughter, that's what I call
karma". However, it is ironic that Kanye mentions "Father, forgive me, I'm scared of
the karma". Kanye has finally grown out of the person he used to be, but he is still
afraid of his past wrongdoings catching up to him.
The verse is honest, sincere, and clever all at once; I especially enjoy the callbacks to
"Monster". The singing is calming and introspective, and the layered vocals towards
the end reminds me of a church choir - a stylistic choice prevalent on "The Life of
Pablo". The soothing voice makes the singing almost sounds like a lullaby, which
complements the theme about children and growing up. I am glad that Kanye chose
to explore this more slow-paced, heartfelt style of songwriting.

## Final Thoughts
Katherine: My top picks for this album are "Ghost Town" and "All Mine", in that order. Can I just say I just wanted a "serious" version of "Lift Yourself" but it's okay. Poopidy scoop.

Ken: A few events surrounding the release of Ye caught my attention. Kanye West reportedly paid $85,000 for a picture of Whitney Houston's bathroom and asked Pusha T to use it as the cover art for his most recent album, Daytona. As for the cover art of Ye, Kim Kardashian said his husband took a photo using his cellphone on his way to the listening party for Ye in Wyoming. Moreover, on the 4th track of Ye, Wouldn't Leave, Kanye raps "I said slavery a choice. They said hi Ye", which means the lyrics were written relatively recently. I find these events particularly interesting because of how last-minute and spontaneous they are. Kanye is famously known to have spent over 5,000 hours on the making of Power, and now he is making last-minute changes to not just his own album but also someone else's. I believe the lyrics on Ye suffered
as a result of this spontaneity from Kanye, and this is my biggest problem with this
album. But who knows, maybe Kanye will make changes to Ye in the future just like he
did with The Life of Pablo. Overall, I still really enjoy this new direction Kanye is going
after and I can't wait to hear more.

KENTHONY LINTANO: FAV TRACKS: GHOST TOWN, NO MISTAKES.

Katherine: I think should listen to his other albums now.
