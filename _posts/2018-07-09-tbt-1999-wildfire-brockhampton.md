This is the boy-bandiest that Brockhampton has ever been.

- [X] Outkast Vibes
- [X] N-Sync Vibes
- [X] La La La's

[Contextual reference] They also teased the possibility of a new (something) because they tweeted JULY 6 and then deleted it. E D G Y.

Is this song okay? I think so. It's not the best of Brockhampton, but it certainly is different. GJ Joba tho. I really like his part. The flute also adds an interesting "texture" to this song. N-Sync-y part starts with Bearface. Oh boy, it is a little bit off-putting with the crisp, clicky hits and singing. I'm not super wild about this song, but Brockhampton has proven they can actually boy-band? Yes.
