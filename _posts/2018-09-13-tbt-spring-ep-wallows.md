Wallows. I definitely didn't know about this band until I saw something from Dylan Minnette (from 13 Reasons Why, yes I watched it. I also read the book btw). I also saw them on lineups like Lollapalooza, so I had to check out what kind of music Dylan was making. Turned out to be indie rock, so of course I was curious to see what their music sounded like.

### Ground

This is kind of your standard indie rock song. It doesn't really stand out as the first track. I'm not sure if I'm going to remember this one by the end of the album.

Score: 6/10

### It’s Only Right

The songs starts with this rough guitar and then follows up with this cleaner lead guitar. I get this instant shoegazy feel mixed in with some surf rock. This one is a little more upbeat than the last song. I like the vocals on this one.

Score: 7/10

### Let the Sun In
V a m p i r e w e e k e n d vibes in this verse (just the sound of it):
> And some would like it best if they're headed for your chest

I really like the trumpet that feels like it drifts through this song.

Score: 8.5/10

### These Days
This song starts off with a light, fun feel. They talk about that feeling that we get when we want to be with someone, but they’re with someone else. I think this song had the most unique sound out of the songs we've heard so far. Guitar solooooooo, pretty good. The piano is quite bright and bouncy, which makes me want to listen to this song over and over again.
If Wallows had to have an individual, unique sound...I hope it’s what this song had.
The wrap-up of this song with the acoustic guitar was also pretty good and leads right into 1980s Horror Film.

Score: 9/10

### 1980s Horror Film
Man the Smiths’ vibes in this one is so STRONG. It’s p strong. The dude could be Morrissey Jr.

He could be singing

> Please, please, please let me get what I want


and I wouldn't have noticed (ok, maybe just a little).
This slower song is also a good contrast to the previous song, being a slower take on another love topic of unreciprocated love.

Score: 8.5/10

### Pictures of Girls
Ah, the shoe-gaziest song of them all. This song starts out pretty strong.
This songs talks about the distance between two people who are in love, but struggle to cope with that distance. The singer talks about the yearning for something real and for the person to be close to them.

Score: 8.5/10

# Final Thoughts

Overall, I think Wallows did well on this debut EP. It shows us of the sound and direction that their group wants to produce. Indie rock songs about love aren't usually intensely deep, but it's not like they need to be anyways. These are some solid unrequited love indie rock songs. I'd say "These Days" is my favorite for sure; this one has been on repeat for a while.
